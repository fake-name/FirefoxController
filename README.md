### Firefox Remote Control interface and debug protocol and toolkit.   

Basically the same general concept from my [ChromeController](https://github.com/fake-name/ChromeController) 
project, but for Firefox.

This exists primarily because chromium is becoming progressively more enshittified. There are also some decisions
it has made that make properly puppeteering it more of a pain in the butt then they should be.

This is partially an experiment with vibe-coding, though it's been heavily hand-audited and verified post code-generation.
